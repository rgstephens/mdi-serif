- Bubble should have Buttons for Paying Bill & Scheduling Appt
- List of services on main page

### Verbage

But I like the idea of condensing our front page to that small blurb and then use that bubble for contact information. In addition, is it possible to build into that bubble, the additional link-buttons for scheduling a visit or paying a bill?
 
Beneath that is a section that lists out the services, where we can take the six distinct services on the current site and place them here with a link to a full description of the service etc.
 
The menu, then, can read “Services”, “Team”, “What to Expect”, “Contact”
 
Services can show all services like it currently does, including the links to the questionnaire’s and location info.
Team can still highlight the Radiologist
What to Expect Can include the same information. In the forms to download, I think we should include a form for a Good Faith Estimate Info document. I’ve attached one here. They are very necessary in today’s medical world.
Contact this should keep the Scheduling number and the breakdown of services, but also merge with the Locations tab so that on this one tab we should add the Locations there.

You have the right to receive a
“Good Faith Estimate”

explaining how much your medical care will cost

Under the law, health care providers need to give patients who don’t have
insurance or who are not using insurance an estimate of the bill for medical
items and services.
• You have the right to receive, and also request, a Good Faith Estimate
for the total expected cost of any non-emergency items or services. This
includes related costs like medical tests, prescription drugs, equipment, and
hospital fees.
• Make sure your health care provider gives you a Good Faith Estimate in
writing at least one (1) business day before your medical service or item, if
the service is scheduled at least three (3) days in advance.
• If you receive a bill that is at least $400 more than your Good Faith Estimate,
you can dispute the bill.
• Make sure to save a copy or picture of your Good Faith Estimate.
For questions or more information about your right to a

Good Faith Estimate, visit www.cms.gov/nosurprises or call (800) 985-3059.
