A Bone Mineral Density (BMD) scan (DEXA Scan) measures and evaluates possible bone loss (or low bone mass) to determine if you have osteoporosis. Very low levels of radiation are used to obtain BMD values of your hips and lower back. 

To determine if you have bone loss, the Bone Densitometry’s computer program compares your BMD measurements with normal values of young adults, as well as your age group, sex, and ethnicity. 

Our Radiologist will use the information to provide an accurate diagnosis. This technology is today’s established standard method for measuring bone mineral density (BMD).
