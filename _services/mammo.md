Digital Mammography

![Mammogram](/images/mamm.jpg)

Our digital mammography program is accredited by the American College of Radiology.

MDi offers the only state-of-the-art digital mammography technology on Maui.  This technology allows us to provide the highest quality of care in the early detection of breast cancer.  Digital mammography (versus screen-film mammography) employs a computer to produce images of the breast. Our Radiologists view the digital images on monitors which adjust for brightness and contrast, and use high-resolution magnification for close-up evaluations of small sections, one at a time.  This allows for detection of changes in the breast (potential early signs of cancer) at earlier stages than ever before.  

We at Maui Diagnostic Imaging follow recommendations set forth by the American Cancer Society and the American College ofDigital Mammography Radiology that states the use of annual screening mammography and clinical breast examination for all women begin at age 40.

Mammography is a powerful tool in identifying the presence of breast cancer early. Breast cancer is 97% treatable if found early.
