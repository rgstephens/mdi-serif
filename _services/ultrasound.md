Ultrasound (or sonography) is a diagnostic medical procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to create images of organs, tissues, and blood vessels.  This technology is often used to examine the abdomen, breasts, female reproductive system, prostate, testes, blood vessels, fetus, and soft tissue masses.

Increasingly, Ultrasound is used to detect vascular diseases that can lead to stroke. This is a very safe and non-invasive procedure which involves no radiation. 

Depending on the specific kind of Ultrasound scan you are having, the following preparation instructions MAY be given to you at time of scheduling.  Please consult your physician to advise.

Abdominal Ultrasound: Nothing to drink or eat 6-8 hours prior to exam. Take medications as usual with small amount of water.
Renal Ultrasound: Drink twenty four (24) ounces of water thirty (30) minutes before appointment and DO NOT URINATE BEFORE EXAM.
OB/Pelvic Ultrasound: Drink at least 24 ounces of water one (1) hour before appointment and DO NOT URINATE BEFORE EXAM.
