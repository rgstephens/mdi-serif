X-Ray uses radiation to take images and is the most frequently used method of medical imaging for diagnosing injuries and many other medical conditions. Positioning of the patient, x-ray machine, and film depend on the type of exam and specific area of the body being studied.

Your physician MAY request multiple individual views. To insure that the image is not blurred, you may be asked to hold your breath and/or not move during the exposure, for 1-2 seconds.

Please inform the health care provider PRIOR to your X-Ray if you are pregnant, may be pregnant. You will be asked to remove jewelry during the exam because metal can flaw the image.
