## Maui Radiologist Wins National ACR Appointment

>  Dr. Andrew Kayes, Medical Director of Maui Diagnostic Imaging, was recently named the Intersociety Private Practice Representative for the American College of Radiology. On January 23, 2015 the nominating committee of the ACR sent out a letter congratulating Dr. Kayes on his recent appointment to this prestigious leadership position. This title holds a 2 year term that will have him traveling to the mainland for conferences that now puts a Hawaii representative on the front line of all things radiological. What makes this nomination even more special is that he is the 1st Hawaii radiologist to ever hold this title. "It's an honor to be chosen to represent the private practice sector and it's a special moment to have radiologists from Hawaii involved in shaping our field of expertise nationally" states Dr. Kayes. He has been an active member of the ACR for 13 years which heralds over 37,000 members. He will officially start his duties as Private Practice Representative in May 2015 at an awards ceremony held in Washington D.C. Dr. Kayes is grateful to be a part of our Maui community where he and his wife, WanYu happily raise their three children, William, Nikki and Henry.
